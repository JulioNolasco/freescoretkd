## How it Works

The FreeScore system creates a private wireless network when it is powered on. Devices such as the ring computer and the judge scoring tablets can connect to the wireless network.

Once connected the devices can use the latest Google Chrome browser to navigate to the webpage at `http://freescore.net` to register the device and download the proper software (i.e. judge scoring system for judge scoring tablets, division management system and computer operator system for the ring computers). 

## Troubleshooting

### No *freescore* wifi

Double-check that the server is plugged in and getting power 
  
### Password doesn't work

Try again; if it fails again, have an admin connect a keyboard and monitor to the server and check the password
  
### Can't connect to http://freescore.net

Double check that the device is connected to `freescore` wifi
  
### http://freescore.net shows a credit score website

Double check that the device is connected to `freescore` wifi and not another wifi network
